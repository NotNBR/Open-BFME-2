// ??_GRva0065F140Derived@@UAEPAXI@Z, retail 0x0065F140 (34B). Scalar-deleting
// destructor of an opaque BfmeDirtyBase-derived class (vtable 0x00CE24A0,
// whose slot 0 lands here; the other eleven slots fold to 0x003B810). Shape
// two of Y2ScalarDeleters.cpp: the derived destructor is INLINE and empty,
// so what survives inlining is the derived vptr reinstall (DIR32
// auto-patch) followed by the call to the matched shared base destructor at
// 0x00658650 (declared here, never defined). The flag test then frees
// through the global one-arg operator delete (matched ??3 row, no member
// delete declared). Per the Y2ScalarDeleters recipe, the defined constructor
// below forces the vtable emission, and ??_G rides along with it; the
// constructor itself is only marked present-unmatched, never claimed. Owner
// identity is unproven (opaque Rva name).
