// Opaque destructor at 0x004E32F2 (14B): stores its vtable, adjusts this to
// the member at +0x0C, and tail-calls the vector destructor at 0x002B80CE
// (pinned opaque ??1RvaVec002B80CE: range-destroy via _Destroy 0x2B70B3, then
// operator delete; element type unproven). Same vptr-plus-adjust-plus-tail-
// jmp shape as the 0x002CEC0A twin (member at +0x04 there, +0x0C here -- this
// class carries an 8-byte head under its vptr). The vector type is only
// declared here (defined nowhere -- the dtor call resolves via the pin).
// Member-vs-base is unprovable from these bytes (modeled as a member).
// Owner identity is unproven (opaque Rva name).
// Upgrades the ??1Rva004E32F2 pin (called by the landed ??_G at 0x004E37B3).
